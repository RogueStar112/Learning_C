Why am I learning C?

1. I want to understand low-level programming better
2. Understanding the fundamentals of CS better, will in turn make programming easier in general.
3. Be able to combine maths knowledge and other subjects seamlessly into my work.
4. Get me distracted from boredom in general by filling in my schedule.
